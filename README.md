## Bank Test - Chuka Okoye-Ahaneku

### My Approach:
* Started with making sure the bank balance began with zero then worked my way up to adding more features like deposit and withdraw to said balance. 

* Making sure that they coincide with the actions of adding and removing money, then used an empty array of transactions, so that it stores the user's history.

* The statement prints the date/credit format first, then sorts through the transaction array to print the first transaction on the bottom.

### How to run:
```
bundle install
irb
require './lib/bank.rb'
bank = Bank.new
```

### How to run RSpec test
